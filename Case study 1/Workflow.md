# About Dataset

Nutritional values, including Calories and Micro-nutrients from six of the largest and most popular fast food restaurants:

McDonald's
Burger King
Wendy's
Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)
Taco Bell
Pizza Hut

Attributes include: Calories, Calories from Fat, Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Cholesterol, Sodium, Carbs, Fiber, Sugars, Protein, and Weight Watchers Points (where available).

## I decided to ask myself and answer the following questions:

### 1. How many meals does each restaurant offer in total?
### 2. What is the average amount of calories per meal in each restaurant and in all restaurants altogether?
### 3. Upon establishing the average calories, which restaurant contains the highest amount of meals with calories amount > average? 
### 4. When selecting 5 top meals with the highest calories and the top 5 meals with the lowest calories, do the top 5 come from the same restaurant?
### 5. How much sodium to these meals contain? Do these top 5 meals contain higher amount of sodium than recommended daily dose? (2.3 g) How many meals in all restaurants exceed this amount 2x, 4x, 8x?

These questions will all be answered using _Excel/Google Sheets_ and visualised in a _Tableau_ dashboard. [link](url)
